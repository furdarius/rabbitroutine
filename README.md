# Rabbitmq Failover Routine

Lightweight library that handles RabbitMQ auto-reconnect and publishing retry routine for you.
The library is designed to save the developer from the headache when working with RabbitMQ.

**rabbitroutine** solves your RabbitMQ reconnection problems:
* Handles connection errors and channels errors separately.
* Takes into account the need to [re-declare](https://godoc.org/github.com/furdarius/rabbitroutine#Consumer) entities in RabbitMQ after reconnection.
* Notifies of [errors](https://godoc.org/github.com/furdarius/rabbitroutine#Connector.AddAMQPNotifiedListener) and connection [retry attempts](https://godoc.org/github.com/furdarius/rabbitroutine#Connector.AddRetriedListener).
* Supports [FireAndForgetPublisher](https://godoc.org/github.com/furdarius/rabbitroutine#FireForgetPublisher) and [EnsurePublisher](https://godoc.org/github.com/furdarius/rabbitroutine#EnsurePublisher), that can be wrapped with [RetryPublisher](https://godoc.org/github.com/furdarius/rabbitroutine#RetryPublisher).
* Supports pool of channels used for publishing.
* Provides channels [pool size](https://godoc.org/github.com/furdarius/rabbitroutine#Pool.Size) statistics.


## Usage

```
go get github.com/furdarius/rabbitroutine
```


### Consuming
You need to implement [Consumer](https://godoc.org/github.com/furdarius/rabbitroutine#Consumer) and register
it with [StartConsumer](https://godoc.org/github.com/furdarius/rabbitroutine#Connector.StartConsumer)
or with [StartMultipleConsumers](https://godoc.org/github.com/furdarius/rabbitroutine#Connector.StartMultipleConsumers).
When connection is established (*at first time or after reconnect*) `Declare` method is called. It can be used to
declare required RabbitMQ entities ([consumer example](https://github.com/furdarius/rabbitroutine/blob/master/consumer_example_test.go)). 


Usage example:

```go

// Consumer declares your own RabbitMQ consumer implementing rabbitroutine.Consumer interface.
type Consumer struct {}
func (c *Consumer) Declare(ctx context.Context, ch *amqp.Channel) error {}
func (c *Consumer) Consume(ctx context.Context, ch *amqp.Channel) error {}

url := "amqp://guest:guest@127.0.0.1:5672/"

conn := rabbitroutine.NewConnector(rabbitroutine.Config{
    // How long to wait between reconnect
    Wait: 2 * time.Second,
})

ctx := context.Background()

go func() {
    err := conn.Dial(ctx, url)
    if err != nil {
    	log.Println(err)
    }
}()

consumer := &Consumer{}
go func() {
    err := conn.StartConsumer(ctx, consumer)
    if err != nil {
        log.Println(err)
    }
}()
```

### Publishing

For publishing [FireForgetPublisher](https://godoc.org/github.com/furdarius/rabbitroutine#FireForgetPublisher)
and [EnsurePublisher](https://godoc.org/github.com/furdarius/rabbitroutine#EnsurePublisher) implemented.
Both of them can be wrapped with [RetryPublisher](https://godoc.org/github.com/furdarius/rabbitroutine#RetryPublisher)
to repeat publishing on errors and mitigate short-term network problems.

Usage example:
```go
ctx := context.Background()

url := "amqp://guest:guest@127.0.0.1:5672/"

conn := rabbitroutine.NewConnector(rabbitroutine.Config{
    // How long wait between reconnect
    Wait: 2 * time.Second,
})

pool := rabbitroutine.NewPool(conn)
ensurePub := rabbitroutine.NewEnsurePublisher(pool)
pub := rabbitroutine.NewRetryPublisher(
    ensurePub,
    rabbitroutine.PublishMaxAttemptsSetup(16),
    rabbitroutine.PublishDelaySetup(rabbitroutine.LinearDelay(10*time.Millisecond)),
)

go conn.Dial(ctx, url)

err := pub.Publish(ctx, "myexch", "myqueue", amqp.Publishing{Body: []byte("message")})
if err != nil {
    log.Println("publish error:", err)
}

```

## Contributing

Pull requests are very much welcomed.  Create your pull request, make sure a test or example is included that covers your change and
your commits represent coherent changes that include a reason for the change.

To run the integration tests, make sure you have RabbitMQ running on any host
```
docker run -it --rm --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3.13-management
```

Then export the environment variable `AMQP_URL=amqp://host/` and run `go test -tags
integration`.

```
AMQP_URL=amqp://guest:guest@127.0.0.1:5672/ go test -v -race -cpu=1,2 -tags integration -timeout 5s
```
